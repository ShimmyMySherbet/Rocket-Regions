# This is a fixes only repository
The origonal repository by Trojaner has long since been adbandoned, this a maintained fork.

I will not be doing any optimizations, or feature updates, only core fixes. If you want a more performant and feature rich regions solution, see Advanced Regions on Imperial Plugins.


# Origonal Readme

## Abandoned
Rocket-Regions was the first plugin I have ever made, made in 2015 (!) with almost no improvements to it after that. The plugin got abandoned and will not be updated anymore. In the last 4 years I have learnt a lot more about coding and it was about time to reflect these improvements on a new regions plugin, which is based on modern code and using programming and Unity best practices.

NOTE:
Keep in mind the license below. It still applies.
This plugin can not be reuploaded to Rocket Harbor since the license is not compatible. Rocket Harbor only permits MIT license based plugins, which is not the case here.

Important:

Although Rocket-Regions is licensed as  AGPL v3, you are not allowed to use any parts of Rocket-Regions commercially without written permission. This includes dynamic or static linking or using/copying any code of it. This also includes modified versions.

In a nutshell:

*Not allowed:*
- You are not allowed to create a plugin which uses Rocket-Regions API (for example which adds flags) and sell it without written permission from Trojaner.
- You are not allowed to copy code of Rocket-Regions and use it in a commercial plugin without written permission from Trojaner.
- You are not allowed to sell modified versions of Rocket-Regions without written permission from Trojaner.

*Allowed:*
- You are allowed to create a free and open source AGPLv3 compatible plugin which uses Rocket-Regions API (for example which adds flags) as long as you do not sell it.
- You are allowed to create a free and open source AGPLv3 compatible modified version of Rocket-Regions as long as you do not sell it. It must have the same restrictions as specified here. 
- You are allowed to use Rocket-Regions code in free and open source non-commercial AGPLv3 compatible projects. If the project is too similiar to Rocket-Regions, the "modified version" rule will apply (so it must have same restrictions in that case).

The restrictions above apply to any past Rocket-Regions source code or binary version too.
